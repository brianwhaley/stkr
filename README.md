## About Stkr

Stkr is a sticker sharing application for Slack. You can:
1) Upload images to be shared with your teammates
2) Use the /stkr command to share those images
3) use the /stkrdelete command to remove images as necessary

### Step 1 - UPLOAD

Drag and drop a new sticker to the Stkr App direct message (or add Stkr to a channel) 
and you will have an opportunity to upload each JPG or PNG to reuse as a sticker. 
There is a limit of 50 stickers per workspace.

### Step 2 - SHARE

Type /stkr in your channel to share a sticker that you or one of your teammates have uploaded.

### Step 3 - DELETE
Type /stkrdelete to remove any stickers if you reach 50 or if something was inadvertently uploaded.

## How it Works
Stkr uses all AWS services to implement its features.
API Gateway to manage load and broker requests and responses
Lambda for executing code in a serverless environment
S3 to store images uploaded and shared over slack
DynamoDB for token storage
